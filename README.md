# Cryptographic-File-Encryption-and-Decryption-with-RSA-DES-GUI-Creation-and-Implementation-
A Python-based project implementing RSA (asymmetric) and DES (symmetric) encryption, with performance testing to measure encryption/decryption time and evaluate how file compression sizes change after encryption
